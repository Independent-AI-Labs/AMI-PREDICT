```python
BINANCE_FEES = {
    'spot': {
        'maker': 0.001,      # 0.1% maker fee
        'taker': 0.001,      # 0.1% taker fee
        'with_bnb': {        # 25% discount with BNB
            'maker': 0.00075,  
            'taker': 0.00075
        }
    },
    'vip_levels': {  # Based on 30-day volume
        'vip0': {'volume': 0, 'maker': 0.001, 'taker': 0.001},
        'vip1': {'volume': 50M, 'maker': 0.0009, 'taker': 0.001},
        'vip2': {'volume': 100M, 'maker': 0.0008, 'taker': 0.001},
        # ... up to VIP9 with 0% maker fee
    }
}
```

#### Capital Management
- Testing ranges: $100, $1,000, $10,000, $100,000
- Position sizing: 10% per trade (configurable)
- Compound returns: Reinvest all profits
- Risk management: Stop-loss, take-profit, max drawdown

### 5. Proper Validation (COMPLETED)
- **Temporal Split**: Train on past → Test on future
- **No Data Leakage**: Strict separation of train/val/test

### 7. Next Steps (TODO)

#### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ Clean repository and remove obsolete files
2. ✅ Update documentation
3. ⏳ Set up Intel XPU environment
4. ⏳ Download 2+ years of historical data
5. ⏳ Train models on complete dataset
6. ⏳ Run comprehensive backtests

#### Short Term (Next Session)
1. Add sentiment analysis from Reddit/Twitter
2. Implement order book features (if available)
3. Add cross-exchange arbitrage detection
4. Implement portfolio optimization

#### Medium Term
1. Real-time paper trading
2. Live data streaming
3. Production deployment
4. Risk monitoring dashboard

#### Long Term
1. Reinforcement learning agents
2. Market making strategies
3. Multi-asset portfolio management
4. Automated rebalancing

## 📊 Current Results

### With Limited Data (30 days)
- **Direction Accuracy**: 45-55% (near random)
- **Returns**: Mostly negative after fees
- **Issue**: Insufficient data for pattern learning

### Expected with Full Data (2+ years)
- **Target Accuracy**: 55-65%
- **Target Sharpe**: 1.0-2.0
- **Target Annual Return**: 10-30% after fees
- **Key**: Consistent small gains, not home runs

## 🎯 Reality Check

### What's Achievable
- **Professional Quant Funds**: 15-25% annual returns
- **Top Hedge Funds**: 20-30% in good years
- **Retail Traders**: 5-15% (if profitable at all)
- **Our Target**: 10-20% consistent returns

### What's NOT Achievable
- 1000%+ returns (market inefficiency doesn't allow)
- 90%+ accuracy (markets are noisy)
- Zero drawdowns (risk is inherent)
- Get-rich-quick schemes (patience required)

## 💡 Key Insights So Far

1. **Data is King**: Need LOTS of quality data (years, not days)
2. **Fees Matter**: Even 0.1% adds up quickly with frequent trading
3. **Overfitting is Real**: Models memorize noise without proper validation
4. **Simple Often Wins**: Complex models don't guarantee better performance
5. **Risk Management Critical**: Protecting capital > chasing returns

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.12
- **ML Frameworks**: PyTorch, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost
- **Data**: Pandas, NumPy, SQLite
- **APIs**: Binance, CCXT
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, Docker (planned)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana (planned)

## 📈 Metrics We Track

- **Accuracy**: Direction prediction accuracy
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Max Drawdown**: Worst peak-to-trough loss
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / Gross loss
- **Fees Impact**: Total fees as % of capital

## 🚨 Current Status

**Repository**: CLEANED (removed 30+ obsolete files)
**Data Download**: READY (download_historical_data.py)
**Models**: READY (run_deep_learning.py with CPU + GPU support)
**Features**: COMPREHENSIVE (50+ features)
**Backtesting**: REALISTIC (with proper fees)
**Validation**: PROPER (no data leakage)
**Documentation**: UPDATED

**Next Actions**:
1. Set up fresh virtual environment
2. Install dependencies (including XPU support)
3. Download historical data
4. Run deep learning experiments
5. Execute 24-hour benchmark test
