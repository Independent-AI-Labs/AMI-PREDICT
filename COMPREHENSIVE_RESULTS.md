- ✅ Tested multiple trading strategies

## Performance Results

### Model Training Results
| Model | Validation Accuracy | Training Time | Parameters |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| AttentionTCN | 75.47% | 177s | 352,129 |
| Baseline TCN | 50.8% | 142s | 198,401 |

### Backtesting Results (2023 Full Year)

#### Original System
- **Average Return**: -60.84%
- **Average Win Rate**: 17.04%
- **Average Sharpe**: -1.19
- **Average Max Drawdown**: -60.86%

#### Improved System with Risk Management
- **Total Return**: -73.70%
- **Win Rate**: 28.95%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -0.71
- **Max Drawdown**: -73.80%
- **Profit Factor**: 0.35

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Training-Trading Disconnect
The fundamental issue is the mismatch between model training objectives and trading requirements:
- **Training**: Optimized for classification accuracy
- **Trading**: Requires profitable entry/exit timing
- **Result**: High accuracy doesn't translate to profitable trades

### 2. Market Efficiency
Cryptocurrency markets, especially BTC/USDT on minute timeframes, are highly efficient:
- Arbitrage opportunities are quickly eliminated
- Technical patterns are widely known and traded
- High-frequency traders dominate short timeframes

### 3. Transaction Costs
Even with low fees (0.1%), frequent trading erodes profits:
- 677 trades generated -73.70% return
- Each round trip costs 0.2% minimum
- Slippage adds additional costs

### 4. Label Engineering Challenge
Creating proper trading labels is extremely difficult:
- Only 0.13% of samples were profitable with 2% stop/3% take profit
- Market noise dominates on minute timeframes
- Risk/reward ratios are unfavorable

## Technical Achievements

### Successfully Implemented
1. **XPU Acceleration**: Full Intel Arc A770 utilization
2. **Data Pipeline**: Efficient processing of millions of records
3. **Feature Engineering**: 15+ technical indicators and microstructure features
4. **Risk Management**: Stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing
5. **Market Regime Detection**: Trending/ranging/volatile classification
6. **Experiment Tracking**: Comprehensive logging and comparison
7. **Backtesting Framework**: Realistic simulation with costs

### Code Quality
- Modular architecture with reusable components
- Comprehensive documentation
- Git version control with detailed commits
- Clean separation of concerns

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Infrastructure**: XPU acceleration provided significant speedup
2. **Data Management**: SQLite + Parquet hybrid approach was efficient
3. **Experiment Tracking**: Essential for model comparison
4. **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators provided useful signals

### What Didn't Work
1. **Pure ML Approach**: Models overfit to historical patterns
2. **High Frequency Trading**: Minute-level too noisy for retail trading
3. **Complex Architectures**: Attention mechanisms didn't improve trading
4. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Percentile-based signals were arbitrary

## Recommendations for Future Work

### 1. Strategy Pivot
- Move to **daily/4-hour timeframes** for clearer trends
- Focus on **swing trading** rather than scalping
- Implement **portfolio approach** with multiple assets

### 2. Alternative Approaches
- **Market Making**: Provide liquidity rather than directional bets
- **Arbitrage**: Cross-exchange or triangular arbitrage
- **Options Strategies**: Use predictions for options pricing
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate news and social media

### 3. Risk Management Improvements
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Based on volatility and confidence
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Markowitz or Kelly Criterion
- **Regime-Specific Strategies**: Different approaches for different markets
- **Drawdown Limits**: Hard stops at -10% monthly

### 4. Model Improvements
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple weak learners
- **Online Learning**: Adapt to changing market conditions
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn optimal trading policies
- **Meta-Learning**: Learn when to trade vs when to stay out

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated:
1. **Technical Proficiency**: Built complete end-to-end trading system
2. **XPU Utilization**: Leveraged Intel Arc A770 for acceleration
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough evaluation with realistic constraints
4. **Documentation**: Detailed tracking of all experiments

However, the results clearly show that:
- **Profitable algorithmic trading is extremely difficult**
- **ML models alone are insufficient for trading success**
- **Market efficiency limits opportunities on short timeframes**
- **Transaction costs significantly impact profitability**

The project provides a solid foundation for future research but requires fundamental strategy changes to achieve profitability.
